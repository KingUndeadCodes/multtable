# How to run
1. Download the "DDP" zip file from https://github.com/NotLe0n/Die-Deutsche-Programmiersprache/releases (at least v1.2)
2. Unpack the zip file.
3. If you have .Net installed you can use the exe in `exe > framework-dependent` otherwise use the exe in the folder for your operating system (`exe > win/mac/linux`).
4. Open the .ddp file using DDP.exe. You can also use the command line with the path of the ddp file as the first argument like this: `DDP.exe %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\multtable.ddp`
