# Multtable
Multtable is a collection of multiplication tables in various languages.

This project was created as a joke based on one of my brother's CS assignments.

# Goals
The goal is to write the same exact thing in as many different programming languages as possible, and in as many frameworks as possible.
Filling out the entirity of the [Wikipedia List of Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) is unlikely but would be very nice.

# Currently completed languages
 * C#
   * Console App
